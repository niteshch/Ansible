# This ansible playbook is used to launch Apache Spark slaves and attach them to the master.
# The master node is identified by the tag:Name and tag:Env of the master node.
# This playbook helps us to scale up and scale down a spark environment.
#
# As part of this playbook, we provision a slave instance and install the software
# and python dependencies required to run python code on a Spark cluster.
#
# The number of slaves to be launched is also controlled by `cluster_group_count` variable in
# `Provision slave nodes` task. Please modify that variable to launch `n` slaves.
#
# In order to specify different environments (e.g. production, development, test), please
# update the `Env` variable in spark.yml located in deploy/ansible/roles/build-instances/vars directory.
#
# To launch this script, traverse to deploy/ansible directory and run the following command
#
# ```
# ansible-playbook --private-key=<private_key_file> launch-spark-slave.yml
# ```
#
# Note: Please make sure to update the provisioning details in spark.yml located in
#       deploy/ansible/roles/build-instances/vars directory accordingly.
